## Ideas

~~* Using the Parking Masters Meter data set to develop an app to help with finding parking spaces depending on availability at a given time
~* Create an app to have the user input their beginning and end point and would produce a path based on preference of biking/walking and the length of time you want to walk . Possible addition: add an option for people to upload photos of plants (or other?) into a public repository and users can also choose to want to see a specific plant by clicking on the picture and the trail would be altered accordingly.
    * Addition: use machine learning to look for inappropriate pictures, can use cats for proof of concept
~* Possibly something to do with water quality and usage, that way we leave the highest quality water for drinking, maybe a little less quality fo rlike water grass, etc?
~~

* Use zoning data to recommend going to certain area based on mood? Like someone could type in, I am in the mood to see historical buildings or go to  a park or mall and suggest an area of town to visit based on zoning laws. Could incorporate Machine Learning/AI in the sense that the app could build an intuition for mood to where the person wants to go. Like for the first few times you could type in your mood and where you want to go to help the app tailor suggestions for later usage when you just input a mood?
    * An App similar to pokemon go where it shows local points of interest to walk to
    * It shows alternative historic routes, usecase would be for people during covid and quarrantine to take pressure off the parks and mantain social distancing
    * plot paths and current pathfinding onto it
    * a way to submit new check in spots, have it crowdfunded and supported. eg, 30 days and it exists, if nobody gives it an upvote then it becomes either less significant or goes into a categeory of an overlooked gem in the local area
    * 
    
* If we are building a path suggestor, then it would be interesting to tailor the results based on some kind of personality test. Some questions we could ask would be like:
    * do you have pets
    * do you have children
    * do you like trees or sidewalks more
    * do you want to go by a river
    * do you want mostly nature
    * do you want to see ruins
    * do you like bridges
    * do you like trains
    * do you want to find a new shop or do you want to go into nature
    

* Based on those results, we have 3 to 4 profiles of a kind of walker who matches that profile and then we can recommend paths which include more features
    * if they want a river, then include more paths that take the user to some water feature or edge
    * if they want to find a new shop, focus on talking a walk into the downtown area but also showing them a local art installiation
    * If they have pets, recommend a path of only trees and fire hydrants for the dog to pee on
    * And we could make a cute little text generator that is a description of the path based on the features
    * if it's mostly water : ah, you might get wet
    * it if's mostly firehydrants: name it fireman's path
